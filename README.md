# GPS navigation system

A web based navigation system that run on the raspberry pi and used a gps module. It checks if the vehical is near trafiic light and sends the a message to the server. the server inturn changes the signal to let the vehical pass through without any delays. over here the projects "sends a message" throgh SMS because that is what the team required but the code can easily be changed to send any other data.
